- **PDF Knowledge Base**: Upload cybersecurity documents to expand the system's knowledge
- **Smart Retrieval**: RAG architecture finds the most relevant information from your documents
-  **Fast API**: RESTful API built with FastAPI for high performance
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and status endpoints
- **Topic Organization**: Predefined cybersecurity categories for better content management
-  **Testing Suite**: Automated tests to verify system functionality
-  **Extensible**: Easy to integrate with different vector stores and LLMs

## Use Cases

- **Security Training**: Interactive cybersecurity education platform
- **Help Desk Support**: Automated first-line security question answering
- **Policy Guidance**: Quick access to organizational security policies
- **Incident Response**: Rapid retrieval of security procedures and best practices
- **Compliance**: Easy lookup of regulatory requirements and standards

##  Architecture

This system implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture:

```
User Query â†’ Document Retrieval â†’ Context Enrichment â†’ AI Generation â†’ Response
```

1. **Document Ingestion**: PDFs are processed and stored in a searchable format
2. **Query Processing**: User questions are analyzed and relevant context is retrieved
3. **Answer Generation**: AI model generates responses based on retrieved context
4. **Response Delivery**: Structured JSON response with sources and metadata

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- 4GB+ RAM recommended for optimal performance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```python
def test_system():
    """Test basic RAG functionality"""
    test_questions = [
        "What is social engineering?",

# Test query endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is two-factor authentication?"}'

# Upload a PDF
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/upload-pdf" \
  -F "file=@security_guide.pdf" \
  -F "source_name=Security Guidelines" \
  -F "topic=general"
```
